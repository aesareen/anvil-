ðŸ“šEduMatch is dedicated to simplifying the college planning process. Our mission is to provide students and parents with the tools they need to make informed decisions about higher education. Through our user-friendly platform, we offer personalized insights and comprehensive resources, ensuring that each user finds the perfect fit for their academic, social, and financial needs.

## Current Features
- The ability to compare 3 North Carolina Colleges and various basic information about them (financial cost, overall acceptance rate, campus type, etc...) in a seamless, unified format
- Comprehensive data gathered from each of the college's most recent course catalogs about the most popular majors and the ability to compare career pathways at each school
- Department-specific RateMyProfessor scores that allow you to see how students perceive their faculty and how this differs by department

## Technologies Leveraged
- Selenium was used for much of the data scraping from RateMyProfessor and the respective university catalogs, ensuring that even with future updates to both of these webpages, EduMatch is able to stay with the times and provide users with the most up-to-date information
- On the frontend, Anvil was employed for rapid prototyping and development of a proof-of-concept UI that gives users a simple and accessible manner to compare colleges with their respective majors in mind

## Future Steps
- We have a number of ideas of future ideas and metrics to incorporate into EduMatch to ensure that every facet of college life is included; from academic life to each college's social scene, we want to allow users to have all of the data they need to make the most informed decision
  -  The ability to add AP Classes that a student has taken to see applicable credit, an integrated hub to see scholarship opportunities for each university, and a tailored equation to score each college according to preferences are just a few of the ideas that we hope to bring to EduMatch
- We also would love to allow students to bookmark particular colleges and save them for later, allowing them to keep track of the universities they're falling in love with and see how they stack up to their current favorites
